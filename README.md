# Restaurant Inspection Predictions

### Predicting whether a restaurant in Boston will pass its health inspection, given its prior performane pattern on the same, coupled with its standing in Yelp.

### Motivation

A huge number of food illness outbreaks are sourced back to lack of hygienic practices within a restaurant and the manner in which it operates. To amerliorate this problem, strict regulations exist for F&B establishments when it comes to health standards. City officials carry out regular inspections to monitor the same; thus the work done by them is of huge importance. Unfortunately, like most things, there are never sufficient resources to be able to execute on number of inspections required. Hence, can we apply Data Science to help alleviate this problem?

In this project, I aim to predict restaurants that are most likely to Pass/Fail on a health inspection using classification machine learning models. The predicted outcome can help the authorities better prioritize resources towards restaurants that are expected to Fail. 

### Learning Goals & Tools Used

1. Data Processing, Modelling & Evaluation
  * Balanacing datasets (Random Over Sampler, SMOTE, ADASYN, Random Under Sampler)
  * Classification models (KNearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosted Classifier)
  * Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC curves)
  * Hyperparameter tuning & model selection
2. Data Querying using PostgreSQL
3. Dynamic Visualizations
  * Tableau
  * Streamlit
  
A soft goal is to start creating \*.py files that store repeated function calls. These are intended to provide practice with writing code in a scalable manner that can also be re-used easily for future endeavors.
